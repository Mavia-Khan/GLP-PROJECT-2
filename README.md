# Income Inequality Prediction

Income inequality—when income is distributed unevenly among a population—is a pressing issue in developing nations worldwide. With the increasing adoption of AI and automation, this disparity may grow unless measures are implemented.

This project provides a machine learning-based solution to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain threshold, based on key demographic and socioeconomic indicators. By leveraging advanced predictive models, this solution aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring income levels between census years, enabling policymakers to address income inequality more effectively.
