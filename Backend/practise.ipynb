    "## Income Inequality Prediction\n",
    "Income inequality, where income is unevenly distributed among a population, is a growing global issue, affecting both developed and developing nations. Reducing this inequality is a key goal of the United Nations, as outlined in their Sustainable Development Goal 10. Accurate data and analysis are critical for addressing this socio-economic challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided for this task is from the U.S. Research shows that income levels are influenced by factors such as education, race, employment status, and gender. The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a specific income threshold, with the model's success measured using the F1 score. By leveraging AI, this approach can provide policymakers with timely and accurate insights to better address income inequality, especially between census periods."
